little japanese dice game

Rules:

number of players: 3-12 (one of them is dealer)
everyone starts with random cash (between 60k and 100k)
every player except of dealer make his bet (bet can be from 100 to 20k)
then everybody rolls 3 dice, dealer rolls first
then player's and dealer's combinations are compared according to the list below
(every player is competing with dealer only)
combinations (from the strongest to the weakest):
  1+1+1 => player wins 5 times
  for triple (2+2+2 to 6+6+6) => player wins 3 times (higher triple beat lower triple)
  4+5+6 => player wins 2 times
  for double [2+5+5 (means 2) or 4+1+1 (means 4)] => player wins 1 time
  (higher double beat lower double)
  1+2+3 => player pays twise
if you throw nothing of above (nothing valuable) you still have 2 attempt
after 3 unsuccessful rolls you loose your bet to dealer
if dice jumps out you loose your bet immediately
when everyone rolls, there will be another round
player plays as dealer twise (with the exception of case he rolls 1 or nothing for first round)
then the next player will be dealer and everything starts from the beginning

dealer can't win immediately with 6 or 4+5+6 or triple, others will roll too
likewise if dealer gets 1+2+3 it will be draw if another player rolls the same or his dice jumps out
you can skip dealer turn (so could others do)
